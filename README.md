While i was working with RTP Streaming, i had to interpret the packet type by interpreting bits of the packets. While doing so i wanted to have a tool that i can use to convert HEX to binary in a little endian format so that each HEX number can be conveted to binary.

e.g.,

HEX     :FF
Binary  :1111 1111


HEX     :01
Binary  :0000 0001

HEX     :E1
Binary  :1110 0001
